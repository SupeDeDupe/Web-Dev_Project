# Web-Dev_Project
Remember those old Nintendo games with poor graphics and insanely hard gameplay? The goal of this project was to reimagine that.

The original version of the project was hosted on a server, using PHP and a database, but the server is no longer available. To make setup easier, I've added some HTML files use in place of the PHP files. This way, you don't have to worry about running any PHP.
To play the game locally without running any PHP, clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.
